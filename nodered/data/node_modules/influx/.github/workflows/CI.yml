# events but only for the master branch

  push:
    branches: [master]

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on

    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it

        with:
          # Make sure the actual branch is checked out when running on pull requests
